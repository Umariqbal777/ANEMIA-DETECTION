# ANEMIA-DETECTION
A machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of anemia based on patient health parameters. The project compares multiple models — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting — and deploys the best-performing model (Gradient Boosting Classifier) for accurate predictions.
